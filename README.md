## The Cleaner

A set of scripts that can be used to clean up lab accounts.  The idea of the script is to return the account to a pristine state by deleting everything.

Be **very** careful when running these as they are by their nature destructive!!

See the individual IaaS specific folder for more instructions on running the script for your environment.

 - [AWS](./AWS/)
 - [Azure](./Azure)
 - [GCP](./GCP/)
 - [vSphere](./vSphere/)

## Troubleshooting 
If you experience an error when running the clean up please review [common issues](./common_issues.md) doc to see if there is a known solution.  If no solution can be found then create a github issue
